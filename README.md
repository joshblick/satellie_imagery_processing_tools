# satellie_imagery_processing_tools

This is the Github repository associated with my Master thesis.

All of the tools used in the work associated with creating the thesis are stored here. The large files however need to be stored elsewhere as there are limits in Github. Therefore one can find the following items by navigating through the links to Dropbox, I also detail where the file needs to go in the file structure
